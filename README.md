# TensorPoker
Neural networks based, poker bots.

Dr.Barnett Independent study

This project consists :
1. DQN based poker bot
2. Cards embedding

### DQN based poker bot
The most detailed solution - modular, customizable, commented and tested.

### Cards embedding
Embedding for cards in a hand. Conv net was used. Training by predicting win rate from cards.

All parts use TensorFlow and TensorBoard, witch visualize losses, performance and validation metrics.

Tested in PyPokerEngine (Texas Holdem, no limit).
