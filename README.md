# TensorPoker
Neural networks based, poker bots.

Dr.Barnett Independent study

This project consists :
1. DQN based poker bot
2. Cards embedding

### DQN based poker bot
The most detailed solution - modular, customizable, commented and tested.

### Cards embedding
Embedding for cards in a hand. Conv net was used. Training by predicting win rate from cards.

All parts use TensorFlow.

To run this file, just go to the noteBook folder's trainingDQN. The model is saved inside of cache/model/DQN

Tested in PyPokerEngine (Texas Holdem, no limit).
